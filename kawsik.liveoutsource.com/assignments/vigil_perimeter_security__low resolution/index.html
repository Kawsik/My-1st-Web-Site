            <h2>The risk begins far beyond your front door.</h2>
            <p>Security measures that alert you to break-ins to your premises still leave you vulnerable. That’s because they allow the threat to infiltrate the building before alerting you. Not only does this put you in danger, it needlessly endangers your loved ones and your property.</p>
            <img>
            <p>Appointing security guards might provide a measure of security, but it doesn’t ensure your property is completely secured. Not only is there room for human error on the part of the most diligent guard, all it takes is a moment’s inattention for burglars to force their way into your property.</p>
            <p>When it comes to threats, an offensive approach is always better than a defensive one. Keeping the need for intensive security measures in mind, Ceasefire now provides a foolproof security system that stops burglars in their tracks, before they can penetrate your property. Ceasefire presents Vigil – an alarm-based security system that secures the gates and walls around your property.</p>
            <p>Using dual infra-red detectors to detect unusual activity, Vigil raises the alarm if the walls surrounding your property are breached or if your gate is threatened. Not only does this revolutionary system assure you of the security of your property, the alarm and alerting systems serve as a deterrent to potential threats.</p>
            <p>Vigil is ideal for private homes and villas, factories, residential societies, offices, malls, corporate parks and commercial complexes. After all, it’s perfectly equipped to keeps your property’s perimeter well protected, keeping threats where they belong – outside!</p>

            <span>HX PIR</span><br>
            The most important element in a reliable outdoor detector is accuracy in distinguishing a human from a small animal. The exclusive pyro element on board enables the HX PIR to project an ideal detection pattern, allowing for more accurate detection of humans and less false alarms.</p>
            <br>
            
            <p>
            <img>
            <span>VX PIR</span><br>
            The VX PIR is not only ideal for intruder prevention it can also be used as a safety warning device to alert you if children enter unsafe areas such as the swimming pool. As it plays a recorded message the instant it detects movement, VX PIR can also be used to automatically greet customers entering a store.</p>

            <p>
            <img>
            <span>BX PIR</span><br>
            BX PIR creates 24m unique dual-side detection areas that protect wide horizontal areas around buildings and will trigger alarm before the breakin. With this unit you don't have to worry about false alarms. It doesn't activate unless the upper and lower detection zones detect a moving object.</p>

            <p>
            <img>
            <span>FIT PIR</span><br>
            Versatile and reliable, FIT PIR is the perfect solution for those outdoor areas where environmental disturbances and small animals may cause false alarms. This compact, invisible outdoor sensor is highly reliable and can be used in various locations such as outside windows, near pools, garages, balconies and balcony doors.</p>

Ceasefire Range of Video Door Phones

Your front door is your first line of defence. It is all that stands between your safety and the dangers that lie outside. Who you let in could mean the difference between life and death.

This is where our video door phone systems come in. These devices allow you to take a look at what’s outside without having to open the door like you would in the case of a night latch. And what’s more, you won’t have to rely on the tiny, distorted image you see through a peephole: our sophisticated cameras and monitors provide you with crisp, clear images.

Ceasefire’s Video Door Phone System is your first step towards security.

What is a Video Door Phone System?

Ceasefire provides two variants of this system: the Single Apartment Unit and the Multi Apartment Unit.
